# Tools and libraries:

- use "bun" for all "npm" related activities
- use "commander" for the command line integration
- use "mastra" to make the agent that will perform the mermaid summarization
- use "zod" for functional library support
- make a step in a mastra workflow to output the summarization in a markdown fenced format, e.g.:
```mermaid
$diagram
```
- refer to @mastra.md for documentation on that library.
